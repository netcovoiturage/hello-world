## Hot to use tcpdump

- Capture Packets from Specific Interface. The command screen will scroll up until you interrupt and when we execute tcpdump command it will captures from all the interfaces, however with -i switch only capture from desire interface.
```tcpdump -i eth0```

-Display Available Interfaces
To list number of available interfaces on the system, run the following command with -D option.
```tcpdump -D```

-Capture and Save Packets in a File
As we said, that tcpdump has a feature to capture and save the file in a .pcap format, to do this just execute command with -w option.
`tcpdump -w 0001.pcap -i eth0`

-Read Captured Packets File
To read and analyze captured packet 0001.pcap file use the command with -r option, as shown below.
`tcpdump -r 0001.pcap`

-Capture only TCP Packets.
To capture packets based on TCP port, run the following command with option tcp.
`tcpdump -i eth0 tcp`

-Capture Packet from Specific Port
Letâ€™s say you want to capture packets for specific port 22, execute the below command by specifying port number 22 as shown below.
`tcpdump -i eth0 port 22`

-Capture Packets from source IP
To capture packets from source IP, say you want to capture packets for 192.168.0.2, use the command as follows.
`tcpdump -i eth0 src 192.168.0.2`

-Capture Packets from destination IP
To capture packets from destination IP, say you want to capture packets for 50.116.66.139, use the command as follows.
`tcpdump -i eth0 dst 50.116.66.139`
